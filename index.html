  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>Im a student at the University of Leeds studing Economics.
  I decided to take a break from my studies to figure out what I enjoy.
  Before joining Moringa School, I was working at an insurtech startup.
  This experience definately played a role in me choosing to study coding at
  Moringa Schhol. As soon as I discvoerd my intrest for coding I decided to persue it.
  Furthermore, my hobbies include yoga and golf. I also especially enjoy visiting art galleries
  and understanding the meaning behind the paintings and the painters life story. </p>
